rotated_array_search() operates in O(log n). The first step is finding the index of the minimum on the array, which can be done in O(log n) in the function
find_min_index(). In this function, half of the remaining array is discarded from the search in every iteration, meaning we have a O(log n). 
Once we know the index of minimum, we can implement a binary search algorithm slightly modified to take into account that the lowest element 
is not in 0, but instead in the index found previously.
